# Dynamic-Dashboard-React
Shows how you can use Wijmo controls in dynamic, user-customizable dashboards. Start by selecting a tile type, then click the button to add the new tile to the dashboard. Use the mouse to drag tiles to new positions, or click the close button at the top-right corner of each tile to remove the tile from the dashboard. The sample uses a DragDropTouch class that allows users to drag tiles using touch as well as the mouse. The DragDropTouch class was copied from the DragDropTouch sample, where it is documented in detail. The tile frame and the tile contents are stored in partial views, so you can easily create and customize new tile types.
